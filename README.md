# Gut Microbiota Features on Nursing Home Admission Are Associated With Subsequent Acquisition of Antibiotic-resistant Organism Colonization

Nursing home (NH) patients often acquire colonization with antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs). We show that patients exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotics during previous hospitalizations have elevated enterococcal relative abundances on NH admission and higher risk of subsequent ARO acquisition. Our findings suggest that interventions preventing ARO spread should extend beyond NH doors.
